  <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Adnan, a product designer based out of the United Kingdom. Currently Iâ€™m a Design Lead at Litmus focused on designing enterprise class software.</p>

  <p>As a designer, Iâ€™m a strong advocate for the user and believe in finding solutions that solve actual user problems. I favor whiteboards to design tools and avoid solutioning until Iâ€™ve fully understood a problem space. Discovery is critical to my process, as a result Iâ€™ll often be found talking to customers, internal stakeholders and scrum owners.</p>

  <p>In the past Iâ€™ve worked for several startups and brands including Placester, InStyle, SapientNitro, Harvard Business School.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™m self taught and have been designing since I was 16 years old, what started off as a hobby quickly turned into a full-time career path. Iâ€™ve embraced working remotely since 2014, as a result you will often find me behind the camera of a Loom recording, talking to customers, sketching out ideas or running design sprints within scrum teams together - all remotely!</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ve worked across several cross-functional Agile teams striving for continuous improvement and incrementally shipping product. I value effective communication and strong collaboration. I strongly believe that teams do their best work when they solve problems together. As a designer, I try to bring people together on a shared goal.</p>

  <p>Outside of work, I enjoy talking about cars, technology and sometimes travel. My most recent adventure took me through Europe, where I visited six countries across two weeks.</p>
