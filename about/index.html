    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="byline">A designer living in 🇬🇧, fully remote since 2014. Sometimes I travel.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Hi 👋! I’m Adnan, a product designer based out of the United Kingdom. Currently I’m a Design Lead at Litmus focused on designing enterprise class software.</p>

  <p>As a designer, I’m a strong advocate for the user and believe in finding solutions that solve actual user problems. I favor whiteboards to design tools and avoid solutioning until I’ve fully understood a problem space. Discovery is critical to my process, as a result I’ll often be found talking to customers, internal stakeholders and scrum owners.</p>

  <p>In the past I’ve worked for several startups and brands including Placester, InStyle, SapientNitro, Harvard Business School.</p>

  <p>I’m self taught and have been designing since I was 16 years old, what started off as a hobby quickly turned into a full-time career path. I’ve embraced working remotely since 2014, as a result you will often find me behind the camera of a Loom recording, talking to customers, sketching out ideas or running design sprints within scrum teams together - all remotely!</p>

  <p>I’ve worked across several cross-functional Agile teams striving for continuous improvement and incrementally shipping product. I value effective communication and strong collaboration. I strongly believe that teams do their best work when they solve problems together. As a designer, I try to bring people together on a shared goal.</p>

  <p>Outside of work, I enjoy talking about cars, technology and sometimes travel. My most recent adventure took me through Europe, where I visited six countries across two weeks.</p>
