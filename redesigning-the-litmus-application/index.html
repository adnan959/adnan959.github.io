        <large>Building a faster email testing experience for users to be able to quickly iterate and test on thier emails prior to sending.</large>

        <p>Litmus builds powerful tools for email designers, developers and marketers to help build, test, and analyze campaigns. One of Litmus’ primary offerings in 2015 was email previews, it helped email professionals render email previews across 90+ real email clients such as Apple Mail, iOS Mail or Outlook.</p>

        <p><a href="https://litmus.com/blog/introducing-adnan-senior-designer" target="_blank">I joined Litmus</a> as the second design team member in 2015. The company had made significant investment in its backend infrastructure, and were looking to scale the platform</p>

        <h4>Oppertunity</h4>

        <p>Email Previews took approximately 15 mins to render, if there were visual issues with the email, the HTML would have to be re-uploaded. This means users ended up spending hours of their time waiting for tests to finish rendering.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/old-litmus.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>This not only slowed down their testing workflow, but created fragments of time they could do other work. This also inhibited adoption of testing into permanent workflows of users, testing was done as an afterthought and not something during the build stage.</p>

        <p>As a result of infrastructural upgrades, the rendering time of previews shrunk from 15 minutes to just 6 seconds -- yes, that's right! This unlocked a clear opportunity for better understanding how previews can be better integrated as part of workflow of users.</p>

        <h4>Discovery</h4>

        <p>We ran a series of customer interviews, design workshops and internal ideation sessions through sketching and low-fidelity design tools. This resulted in discovery of workflows of customers where Litmus could add true value.</p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/roles-and-values.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>We split this up by role and the value that could be derived for that particular role. In the end we distilled down to an over-simplified view of how different users derive value from Litmus. As a result, this helped inform goals behind the redesign.</p>

        <h5>Key Learnings:</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>Customers were picking up on the speed gains, and were excited! This had not been communicated or marketed to customers at this point.</li>
          <li>Users wanted a way to debug their emails right within Litmus, instead of having to context switch during the QA phase.</li>
          <li>Users wanted to be able to test their emails during the build stage, and not just run a test at the end of their build process.</li>
          <li>Users wanted Litmus to do more than just email previews, e.g. show if links are broken in my email or ability to view their email if images are broken.</li>
          <li>For agencies, an improved experience around sharing results with clients.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Building for a faster Email Testing Experience</h4>

        <p>We began by running a series of customer interviews, design workshops and internal ideation sessions through sketching and low-fidelity design tools. Patterns quickly began to emerge where customers not only wanted testing as an afterthought but wanted to embed testing into their email building workflow better.</p>

        <h5>Setting Goals</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>Making Litmus available to a new type of customer by creating additional value, this would help increase overall usage of the platform.</li>
          <li>Improving the existing user experience in light of the faster backend infrastructure, this would help improve retention and delight to existing users.</li>
          <li>Delivering a fresh user interface that complimented existing design trends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Early Wireframes</h5>

        <div class="image-full">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/early-wireframes.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>I dove deeper into this opportunity and worked closely with my <a href="https://dribbble.com/atippins" target="_blank">Lead Designer at the time, Alan Tippins</a>,  to rank some areas we wanted to begin making an impact. We began ideating and sketching low-fidelity solutions that were later on presented to the company.</p>

        <h5>Redesigning the Index Views</h5>

        <div class="image-full">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/redesigning-index-views.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>To get ourselves familiar with the new design components, we started off simple by working on a few of the index views. The Builder was a very visual tool which made it a prime candidate for a grid view. Checklist on the other hand was a QA tool that was less visual, the emphasis was on the completion of all available checks.</p>

        <h5>Integrating Previews into the email Builder</h5>

        <div class="image-full">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/integrating-previews.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>As a result of the faster previews architecture, we were able to integrate email previews directly in to the email building experience. This allowed users to switch between a browser view and a previews view. Users could even drill into a specific email client (e.g. Apple Mail 12), and test their live code within just that client.</p>

        <h5>Introducing Litmus Checklist</h5>

        <div class="image-full">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/introducing-litmus-checklist.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>Checklist was Litmus’ answer towards offering a QA solution, it was targeted specifically for email marketing managers who needed to run a final check before hitting the big frightening send button. Checklist would help capture critical bugs and advocated for a QA workflow, this was inline with a lot of our findings from prior research. Checklist also allowed users to tailor their workflow to add additional steps or requirements if needed.</p>

        <h5>Reskinning Litmus Analytics</h5>

        <div class="image-full">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/reskinning-litmus-analytics.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>The last piece of the puzzle was to bring the existing Litmus Analytics experience up-to-date with the updated user interface. Litmus Analytics or better known in the industry as “pixel tracking” measures critical data relevant to an email send, such as opens and engagement. This lead to the design of a charts library that could be cohesively used across the application. </p>

        <h5>Filling the Gaps</h5>

        <div class="image-full">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/litmus-settings.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <p>Once the new features were complete and existing features updated, it was time to focus on areas of the application that usually do not get enough design love throughout their life. As part of the redesign the settings area was brought up-to-date as well. The bigger chunk of effort was involved improving the billing experience, and building a foundation upon which future experiments to begin taking place.</p>

        <h4>Gathering Feedback</h4>

        <p>The early build of the redesigned platform was tested at Litmus Live (formerly The Email Design Conference), Litmus’ annual conference for #emailgeeks. Its one of the most popular events for email designers of the year and perfect oppertunity to collect feedback.</p>

        <div class="image-full">
          <img src="../images/litmus-redesign/gathering-feedback.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h4>Learnings</h4>

        <p>I’ve often made the mistake of using the word “Launch” or “Ship” for a specific feature set, where as its become clear to me that delivering value to customers in an ongoing and often tediously incremental process. While building new features are a great addon to that value  metric, as designers we need to continously derive learnings to form clear next steps.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Users loved the improvements in the speed of the platform and the reworked interface! Said this would shave hours off of their testing workflow and help send emails faster.</li>
          <li>Overtime Litmus had positioned itself as a previews only company, this pereception made it difficult for certain users to understand Checklist. Once educated, they immidiatley understood the value of Checklist -- this meant we had some additional work to do in this area before launch.</li>
          <li>Delivering a fresh user interface that complimented existing design trends.</li>
        </ul>
